# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This was a fairly easy lab this week. I did not refrain from using google but only for one thing, the text decoration. I was trying to figure out which css property I could incorporate inline to make the HTML and CSS with a dotted underline in the letter.

I didn't feel like tests were necessary to employ in this lab. There was no javascript and the CSS file was already complete for this lab. 

I did refer to the CSS to make sure that each element listed was covered and addressed. 

## Sources and Credits

I used a quick google search for the dotted underline text decoration css property that I got from stack overflow.
